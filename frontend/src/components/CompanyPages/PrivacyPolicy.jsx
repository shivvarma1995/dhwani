                        <p>Please note that identity theft and the practice currently known as "phishing" are of great concern to the Company. We do not and will not, at any time, request Your credit card information/debit card information/financial pin numbers/ Payment Methods and passwords etc. If the Service is available to access by making a payment of subscription fee, then such information (only to the extent necessary) shall be collected, stored and/ or processed by the third-party payment gateway directly, without any access to the Company to any such payment information. User shall then be governed by the terms of use of such third-party payment gateway. Similarly, where you pay a third party application/ service provider for your subscription package as part of an in-app or bundled purchase (for eg. Apple, Amazon, etc.) your payment information is directly collected and controlled by that third party. The Users are expected to read and fully understand the privacy policy of such third-party payment gateway or third-party service providers, as the case maybe, before sharing any information with such third-party payment gateway. Other than providing a confirmation upon receipt of payment from You against Your Account, the Company disclaims all liabilities in relation to Your payment processing by such third-party payment gateway and/ or third-party service provider, as the case maybe, and the collection and processing of any payment information provided by You to such party(ies). You agree and acknowledge that the Company shall not be liable or and in no way be held responsible for any losses whatsoever, either direct, indirect, incidental, or consequential/special, including without limitation any losses due to delay in processing of payment instruction or any credit card/debit card/banking/ payment fraud. You can file any complaint related to payment processing by writing to Us directly on info@futuratech.com and the same will be forwarded to the concerned third-party for redressal.</p>
